Hello! This is my first public Github project. The goals of this project is to:

1. Get closer to the Open Source community & dust off the python skills. 
2. Explore the power of RaspberryPI & dip my toes into IOT
3. See pictures of my dog when I'm not at home :) 

* If you want to see the output of this project, follow MauiBot4000 on Twitter here: https://twitter.com/a_hagouel
